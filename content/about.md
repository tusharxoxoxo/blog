My name is **Tushar Dahiya** and this is my personal space :) \
I am currently a final year undergrad at The National Institute of Engineering, Mysore with major in Information Science Engineering.
I am currently working as a programmer at **[Tietoevry]** doing 5G NR L1 development from the Modem UE side on a custom ASIC for an **Unspecified Client**. Also, I am a co-founder of **[Sticky Piston Studios]** - a jack-of-all-trades company where **we make any advanced tech tick**!

My skills include low-level programming in **C**, **C++** and **Rust**. Being proficient in hardware accelerators, such as **FPGA**s I happen to know some **VHDL** and **SystemVerilog**. Lastly, being a hardcore **gamejammer** I am familiar with the **Unity** engine and other popular tools of the trade.
In my free time I am doing a ton of **bouldering**, learning **hardware hacking**, some **reverse engineering** and taking care of my cute humongous German Shepherd **Bruno**

I have recently graduated with an MSc in **Embedded Systems** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, Sweden and **University of Turku**, Finland as a part of EIT Digital Programme. Thesis titled: *"FPGA accelerated tcpdump using eBPF"* goes into the topic of hardware acceleration of packet capturing in embedded Linux system using an FPGA. It was a cooperative effort between KTH and [Tietoevry].

I have also graduated from **Warsaw University of Technology** with the highest degree for my thesis: *"FPGA based hardware accelerator for musical synthesis for Linux system"*.

You can see both theses under the *Achievements* section below.
